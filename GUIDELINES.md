# Content & Tone Guidelines

**Readlock courses must weave compelling stories that illuminate profound insights through intelligent humor and sophisticated observation, delivering immediate practical value that transforms how users think and act, while embedding knowledge so deeply through spaced repetition, strategic highlighting, and progressive revelation that core principles become permanent mental frameworks accessible weeks and months after completion—creating educational experiences that respect user intelligence, challenge analytical thinking, and balance intellectual rigor with engaging accessibility across mobile-optimized segments that flow seamlessly from curiosity-driven narratives to interactive applications to memorable takeaways.**

## Writing Style

1. **Intelligent humor only** - sophisticated observations, no juvenile jokes or "bro" tone
2. **No nerd humor** - avoid technical puns, programming jokes, or insider references
3. **No spoilers** - build curiosity without revealing conclusions or outcomes
4. **Occasional sophistication** - use elevated vocabulary/grammar sparingly, not consistently
5. **Respect reader intelligence** - assume analytical capability, avoid condescension
6. **Mobile-optimized length** - keep text segments under 150 characters for readability
7. **Observational wit** - point out absurdities through smart examples, not forced punchlines

## Content Structure

8. **Story-driven opening** - start with 2-3 engaging stories before concepts
9. **Active engagement** - stories must involve the user, not passive observation
10. **Progressive revelation** - break complex ideas into digestible chunks
11. **Concrete examples** - anchor abstract concepts in relatable experiences
12. **Elegant syntax** - don't use use em-dashes, participial phrases strategically
13. **No cringe language** - avoid "plot twist," "spoiler alert," casual internet speak
14. **Professional engagement** - maintain serious credibility while being accessible

## User Interaction

15. **Respect intelligence** - don't go too easy, challenge while supporting
16. **Maintain humor balance** - keep wit while respecting analytical capability
17. **No dumbing down** - assume users can handle sophisticated concepts

## Error Feedback

18. **No blame language** - never "wrong answer" or accusatory responses
19. **Empathetic framing** - "Common thought, though..." or "Others thought the same" - don't overuse this.
20. **Educational redirects** - explain why the thinking pattern occurs
21. **Supportive correction** - guide toward better understanding without shame

## Question Design

22. **Humorous options allowed** - questions can include witty, clever choices occasionally
23. **Evidence-based estimates** - all percentage/statistic questions must cite real studies (this issue is VERY important!)
24. **Smart word choice** - fill-in-the-blank answers should be insightful, not obvious
25. **Course introductions** - intro content should use phrases like "In this course we will explore..." to set clear expectations
26. **Stay true to source material** - keep courses focused on the book's actual content rather than forcing business/startup applications when irrelevant
27. **Notable quote placement** - place the notable quote immediately before the outro section

## Content Highlighting System

### Highlight Marker Guidelines

28. **Key insight identification** - use `<rl-marker-green>` tags to highlight essential concepts that users must retain (markers only get revealed when the text is finished)
29. **Principle highlighting** - mark core frameworks, fundamental rules, or breakthrough insights that define the book's value
30. **Strategic restraint** - limit highlights to 1-3 per content segment to maintain impact and avoid visual noise
31. **Complete phrase coverage** - always wrap entire meaningful phrases or sentences, never partial words or fragments

### Highlight Usage Patterns

**What to Highlight:**

- **Core principles**: "The way you frame a question determines the answer you get"
- **Counterintuitive insights**: "Good design makes things visible and provides clear feedback"
- **Memorable frameworks**: "Social Currency, Triggers, Emotion, Public, Practical Value, Stories"
- **Actionable takeaways**: "Research your audience's real decision criteria"
- **Paradigm shifts**: "Supreme excellence consists of breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting"

**What NOT to Highlight:**

- **Examples or stories**: Highlight the principle they illustrate, not the narrative
- **Common knowledge**: Avoid marking obvious or widely-known information
- **Setup context**: Don't highlight background information or story setup
- **Questions or options**: Reserve highlights for explanations and insights
- **Humor or transitions**: Keep wit unmarked to preserve natural flow

### Implementation Specifications

**Tag Structure:**

```html
<rl-marker-green>Essential insight or principle here</rl-marker-green>
```

**Content Integration:**

- **Natural embedding**: Highlights should feel organic within the text flow
- **Sentence boundaries**: Align with natural reading rhythm and grammatical structure
- **Cognitive anchoring**: Mark concepts that users will reference in later content
- **Retention targeting**: Focus on information critical for long-term learning

**Visual Design Considerations:**

- **Subtle prominence**: Highlighting should enhance, not dominate the reading experience
- **Accessibility**: Maintain sufficient contrast for users with visual limitations
- **Mobile optimization**: Ensure highlights remain effective on small screens
- **Dark mode compatibility**: Design highlights to work in both light and dark themes

### Content Type Applications

**Text Segments:**

```
Norman identified the fundamental issue: <rl-marker-green>when design doesn't match human expectations, failure rates skyrocket</rl-marker-green>. This insight transformed how we understand user errors.
```

**Framework Explanations:**

```
Berger's research revealed six psychological triggers: <rl-marker-green>Social Currency, Triggers, Emotion, Public, Practical Value, and Stories</rl-marker-green>. Together, these create the STEPPS framework.
```

**Principle Statements:**

```
Sun Tzu taught that <rl-marker-green>the supreme excellence consists of breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting</rl-marker-green>. This principle applies far beyond military strategy.
```

### Quality Assurance Checklist

**Before Marking Content:**

- [ ] Is this insight essential for understanding the book's core message?
- [ ] Will users need to recall this information in later content?
- [ ] Does this represent a key principle rather than supporting detail?
- [ ] Is the highlighted phrase grammatically complete and meaningful?
- [ ] Are there fewer than 4 highlights in this content segment?

**Review Questions:**

- [ ] Can a user understand the book's main value proposition from highlighted content alone?
- [ ] Do highlights create a logical progression of key insights throughout the course?
- [ ] Are highlighted principles actionable and memorable?
- [ ] Does the highlighting enhance rather than distract from the reading experience?

### Content Curation Strategy

**Highlight Density:**

- **Introduction sections**: 0-1 highlights (build engagement first)
- **Core concept explanations**: 2-3 highlights (mark essential principles)
- **Application examples**: 1-2 highlights (focus on transferable insights)
- **Framework summaries**: 1 highlight (the complete framework or key organizing principle)
- **Conclusion sections**: 1 highlight (memorable final insight)

**Progressive Revelation:**

- **Early highlights**: Broad, foundational concepts
- **Mid-course highlights**: Specific principles and frameworks
- **Advanced highlights**: Application strategies and nuanced insights
- **Summary highlights**: Integration concepts that tie everything together

_These guidelines ensure content maintains intellectual sophistication while remaining accessible and engaging for serious learners. The highlighting system enhances retention without compromising the natural reading experience._

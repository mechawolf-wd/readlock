# Book Summary Apps & “Own-Words” Courses: How the Legal Side Works (Research Dossier)

_Last updated: 2025-11-11_

**Audience:** creators building a course that teaches ideas from books (with quizzes), not verbatim summaries.  
**Jurisdictions covered:** EU (incl. Poland), US. Treat this as practical research, not legal advice.

## 1) How popular summary apps handle rights (models in the wild)

### getAbstract

- **Licensing-first model:** getAbstract states it “works with over 800 publishing houses worldwide to obtain the copyrights to their books before we summarize and add the content to our Library.” citeturn0search1
- Articles and industry coverage also note the **permission-based** approach and long-standing partnerships with publishers/authors. citeturn0search13turn0search9
- Current positioning includes **licensed, tagged content for enterprise/AI copilots** (reinforces that the catalog is rights-cleared). citeturn0search17

**Takeaway:** getAbstract is the clearest example of operating with **publisher permissions/ licenses** before distributing summaries.

### Blinkist

- Blinkist says its “Blinks” are **original writings** (new works) that **distill** ideas; it works with **publishing partners** and **shares revenue** with partners so authors benefit. citeturn0search12

**Takeaway:** Blinkist combines **transformative writing** with **publisher partnerships + revenue sharing**.

### Headway

- FAQ frames summaries as **original works** conveying ideas; it **uses book titles to reference sources** and explains that referencing is necessary to identify the summarized book. Terms and privacy show a mature compliance stance. citeturn2search1turn2search3turn2search11turn2search9

**Takeaway:** Headway publicly positions its content as new expression, with typical platform terms/privacy and explicit source identification.

### Reality check: market optics

- Some authors/publishers criticize summary apps as potentially **substituting** for books and harming sales. (Representative coverage.) citeturn2search13

**Operating pattern across leaders:**

1. **Transformative writing** (not mere condensation, but commentary, structure, pedagogy).
2. **Licensing/permissions** for large-scale, systematic distribution.
3. **Attribution** (book title/author) and **revenue-sharing/partnerships** (varies).

## 2) Legal frameworks you’ll bump into

> The **idea–expression dichotomy** applies in both US and EU: **ideas are not protected**, but the **specific expression** is. Your course can teach ideas in **your own words**; risk rises when you use **verbatim or close paraphrase**, distinctive structure, tables, figures, exercises, etc.

### 2.1 United States — Fair Use (17 U.S.C. § 107)

- The four factors: **purpose/character (transformative?)**, **nature**, **amount/substantiality**, and **effect on the market**. Official text: 17 U.S.C. § 107. citeturn1search0turn1search6
- **Transformative use** strongly helps. Landmark book-scanning decisions (Authors Guild v. Google; Authors Guild v. HathiTrust) upheld fair use for searchability/snippets because of transformation and limited display; they did **not** authorize redistribution of expressive content as a replacement. citeturn1search1turn1search4turn1search7turn1search2turn1search5turn1search10

**Implications for courses:**

- **Commentary/analysis/teaching** in your own words = favored.
- Avoid reproducing **expressive passages**; use only **necessary** quotes with **attribution**.
- Don’t let your materials **compete as a substitute** for the book.

### 2.2 European Union — Quotation & Teaching Exceptions

- The EU **InfoSoc Directive 2001/29/EC** allows exceptions like **quotation for purposes such as criticism or review**; use must be **in accordance with fair practice**, **source indicated**, and limited to what’s necessary. citeturn0search7turn0search19
- Scholarship discussing the **quotation exception** notes it must serve **analysis/commentary/criticism**, not replace the original. citeturn0search15

#### Poland (your timezone/jurisdiction context)

- **Article 29** of the Polish Copyright Act codifies **prawo cytatu**: permitted to quote fragments (or entire short works) in a **self-contained work**, to the extent justified by **explanation, critical analysis, teaching**, with **attribution**. English/PL sources: citeturn3search13turn3search11turn3search0turn3search5
- Practical guidance resources stress **clear attribution** and that quotation should be **proportionate** and **purpose-driven** (education/critique). citeturn3search6turn3search4turn3search16
- Ongoing amendments align Polish law with **DSM** updates; keep an eye on changes. citeturn3search17

**Implications for courses in EU/PL:**

- You can **quote** limited text for **teaching/review** with **source + author named**.
- The **amount** must be **justified**; extensive reproduction (e.g., long tables, figures) is risky without permission.
- **Using ideas** (not expression) in **your own words** with commentary is safest.

## 3) Concrete risks to avoid

1. **Close paraphrasing** that tracks the book’s structure/sentences too tightly → looks like derivative copying.
2. **Republishing distinctive elements** (framework diagrams, tables, exercises, end-of-chapter questions, case studies, illustrations) → typically **not** covered by quotation limits.
3. **Aggregating many long quotes** so your course becomes a **stand-in** for the book → raises “market substitution” concerns under US fair use and EU proportionality. citeturn1search0
4. **Using book covers/figures** without permission (covers are protected artworks; many publishers tolerate small thumbnails for reference, but that’s contextual).
5. **Using trademarks** (series names, logos) as branding — you can **refer** to a book title/author (titles usually not protected by copyright; trademark can apply), but avoid suggesting sponsorship. citeturn2search2

## 4) Practical playbook for an “own words + quizzes” course (compliance-forward)

### A. Content creation rules

- **Teach concepts, not text.** Extract the **ideas** and explain them via your **own examples, analogies, diagrams** that you designed.
- **Attribute sources prominently** (bibliography; per-lesson “inspired by” notes).
- **Use quotations sparingly** (short, necessary, clearly marked, with author + source). EU/PL needs explicit attribution; US fair use also benefits from it. citeturn0search7turn3search13
- **Avoid publisher-owned visuals** (recreate your own charts).
- **Avoid chapter-by-chapter condensation** that mirrors the original — structure your course by **skills/outcomes**, not by the book’s TOC.

### B. Quizzes & assessments

- Design **original questions** that test understanding of the **ideas**.
- Do **not** copy end-of-chapter questions or case studies.
- Where a book coined **unique frameworks (names/labels)**, you may **refer** with attribution, but **explain in fresh words**.

### C. Licensing decision tree (when to seek permission)

Seek a **license** if any of these apply:

- You want to reproduce **long excerpts**, **tables/figures**, **framework diagrams**, **exercises/cases**, or **images**.
- Your course **tracks the book so closely** that a learner can **skip the book**.
- You need **audio narration** of quoted text beyond short snippets.

**How to license:**

- **Direct**: ask the **publisher’s rights department** (or the author for indie works).
- **Collective licensing**: in the UK, **CLA**; other locales have collecting societies; in the US, permissions often handled directly or via **CCC**. (Background/overview resources.) citeturn2search8
- Use a simple **non-exclusive license** describing **exact excerpts**, **media**, **territory**, **term**, **formats**. (Example templates exist in practical law/handbooks.) citeturn2search6turn0search18

### D. Platform hygiene

- **Attribution page** for all sources used.
- **Rights log** (what you quoted, how much, why it fits quotation/fair use, or license IDs).
- **Takedown workflow** (contact email, prompt review).
- **No implication of endorsement** by authors/publishers (clear disclaimer).

### E. Privacy & consumer law basics

- If you ship an app/site, follow your **privacy policy/consent** obligations (e.g., CCPA/CPRA opt-outs in the US; GDPR in the EU). See how a summary app exposes Do-Not-Sell/Share and privacy pages. citeturn2search9turn2search11

## 5) Sample micro-templates

### 5.1 Source attribution block (per lesson)

> _This lesson draws on ideas discussed in:_ **[Book Title]** by **Author Name** (Publisher, Year). See the full reference list for details. All explanations, examples, and visuals are original to this course unless otherwise noted.

### 5.2 Short quotation format (EU/PL-compliant)

> “Quoted sentence (≤ a few lines).” — **Author Name**, _Book Title_ (Publisher, Year), p. X.  
> _Purpose:_ criticism/teaching context: [one line explaining why this quote is necessary].

### 5.3 Disclaimer

> This course is an original educational work. It teaches general ideas and methods from published literature, expressed in the instructor’s own words, with limited quotations for purposes of criticism/teaching. It is **not endorsed by** or **affiliated with** the referenced authors or publishers. Learners are encouraged to read the original works.

### 5.4 Rights log (spreadsheet columns)

- Source | Exact excerpt used (if any) | Word count | Location (page/figure) | Purpose (teaching/critique) | Legal basis (quotation/fair use/license #) | Notes/approval email link

### 5.5 “Red flag” checklist before publishing

- [ ] Any copied diagrams/tables? Get permission or redraw.
- [ ] Any long or numerous quotes? Trim or license.
- [ ] Course structure deviates from book’s chapter sequence.
- [ ] Clear attribution on each lesson and a master bibliography.
- [ ] Takedown process documented.
- [ ] Privacy policy & consent banners live (if applicable).

## 6) If you ever want to scale like a summary app

- **Hybrid model:** Keep your **own-words pedagogy**; for a subset of marquee titles, **negotiate licenses** with publishers to use small but recognizable assets (e.g., a signature diagram) in exchange for **link-backs and revenue share**. (This mirrors how getAbstract/Blinkist partner.) citeturn0search1turn0search13turn0search12
- **Publisher value prop:** courses drive **discovery** and **sales**; share engagement metrics and include **buy links**. (Courts in Google Books cases also noted discovery benefits, though that context was different.) citeturn1search1

## 7) Appendix: Key sources & why they matter

- **US fair use statute + cases** (primary law & summaries): statutory factors and transformative-use jurisprudence set the tone for acceptable educational reuse. citeturn1search0turn1search7turn1search1
- **EU quotation/critique exception** (and national implementations like **Poland’s Art. 29**): enables limited quotation with attribution for teaching/criticism. citeturn0search7turn3search13
- **Industry practice pages (getAbstract, Blinkist, Headway)**: show real-world **permission/partnering** and “original work” positioning. citeturn0search1turn0search12turn2search1
- **Critical coverage**: highlights reputational risk/market-substitution concerns that your course design should avoid. citeturn2search13

---

## 8) TL;DR for your course

- Build **original lessons** that teach ideas with **your own expression**.
- Use **short, necessary quotes** with **attribution**; otherwise paraphrase in fresh language and **redesign visuals**.
- If you need **long excerpts/figures/cases**, **get permission**.
- Keep a **rights log**, **attribution**, and a **takedown channel**.
- If you later expand, consider **publisher partnerships** with **revenue sharing** for select assets.

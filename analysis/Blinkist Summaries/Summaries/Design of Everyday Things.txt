# The Design of Everyday Things by Don Norman

Have you ever struggled to open a door, unsure whether to push or pull? Or fumbled with a seemingly simple device, feeling frustrated when it didn't work as expected? You're not alone. We encounter hundreds of designed objects every day – from door handles and light switches to smartphones and coffee makers – and many of them are poorly designed, causing confusion and frustration.

But that's where good design comes in. When objects are designed well, they become invisible – you use them effortlessly without thinking. In these lessons, I'm going to take you through the key ideas from Don Norman's groundbreaking book "The Design of Everyday Things," one of the most influential design guides ever written. You'll discover the fundamental principles that separate good design from bad design, and learn how to recognize and create products that truly work for people.

In these lessons, you'll also discover:

- why Norman doors are a perfect example of design failure
- what a tea kettle can teach us about giving feedback
- how your mental model of a device determines whether you'll use it successfully

## The Psychology of Everyday Actions

Let's begin with a simple question: why do smart people feel stupid when using everyday objects?

Consider the revolving door at a fancy hotel. You approach confidently, but then hesitate. Which section do you push? How fast should you go? The door itself provides few clues, leaving you to figure it out through trial and error. Despite being an intelligent person, you momentarily feel incompetent.

This illustrates a fundamental principle of good design: when people have trouble using something, it's not because they're stupid – it's because the design is flawed. Don Norman calls these "Norman doors" – doors that give the wrong signals about how to use them.

**The real insight here:** Good design makes the correct action obvious and the incorrect action impossible or difficult. When you have to think hard about how to use something basic, the designer has failed, not you.

## The Six Fundamental Principles of Design

So what makes design intuitive? Norman identifies six key principles that determine whether a design will work smoothly or cause frustration.

**First**, there's **visibility** – the most important parts should be visible, and they should convey the right message about what the product does and how it's used. Think of a well-designed car dashboard where the speedometer and fuel gauge are prominently displayed, while less critical controls are smaller or hidden.

**Second** comes **feedback** – the system should provide clear information about what action has been performed and what has been accomplished. Your smartphone vibrates when you receive a text, letting you know immediately that something happened.

**Third** is **constraints** – there should be physical, logical, or cultural restrictions that guide proper usage. A USB cable can only be inserted one way, preventing you from connecting it incorrectly.

**Fourth**, we need **mapping** – the relationship between controls and their effects should be obvious. The steering wheel turns left to go left, which feels natural and requires no explanation.

**Fifth** comes **consistency** – similar operations should be performed in similar ways. Once you learn to close one window on your computer, you can close all windows the same way.

**Finally**, there's **affordance** – the design should suggest how the object should be used. A door handle affords pulling, while a flat plate affords pushing.

When these principles work together, using an object becomes effortless and intuitive.

## Mental Models and How We Understand Products

Here's something fascinating: you don't actually interact with products themselves – you interact with your mental model of how you think they work.

Take the thermostat in your home. Many people believe that setting it to 90 degrees will heat the house faster than setting it to 70 degrees. This mental model – that the thermostat works like a gas pedal – leads to wasteful energy use. In reality, most thermostats are simple on/off switches. Setting it to 90 degrees just means the system will run longer, not faster.

This mismatch between your mental model and how the system actually works creates problems. The thermostat designer failed to communicate the true nature of the system.

**This shows us that** successful design must account for people's natural mental models. Either design the system to match how people expect it to work, or clearly communicate how it actually works.

## The Power of Natural Mappings

Let's talk about one of the most elegant design solutions: natural mapping.

Consider a car with four electric windows and four window controls. Where should the controls be positioned? Many cars place all four controls on the driver's door in a confusing line. But some cars map the controls to mirror the windows' actual positions – front-left control in front-left position, rear-right control in rear-right position.

This natural spatial mapping means you never have to think about which button controls which window. The physical arrangement of the controls directly corresponds to the physical arrangement of the windows.

**Here's the key insight:** When controls are naturally mapped to their functions, users can operate them without conscious thought, memory aids, or labels. The design itself teaches you how to use it.

## The Art of Giving Good Feedback

Feedback is everywhere in good design, but it's often invisible until it's missing.

Think about walking across different surfaces. Carpet feels soft and absorbs sound, telling you it's safe to walk quietly. Gravel crunches underfoot, warning you that stealth is impossible. A wooden floor creaks, alerting others to your presence. Each surface provides immediate feedback about the consequences of your actions.

Now imagine a touch-screen interface with no feedback – you tap a button and nothing happens. No click, no highlight, no confirmation. You're left wondering: Did I tap it? Should I tap again? Is it broken? Without feedback, even simple interactions become uncertain and frustrating.

**This illustrates a crucial principle:** Good feedback should be immediate, informative, and appropriate to the action taken. It guides users through their interactions and builds confidence in the system.

## When Constraints Actually Help

Most people think constraints limit freedom, but in design, constraints actually enhance usability.

Consider the humble jigsaw puzzle. Each piece has a unique shape that fits only one position. These physical constraints don't make the puzzle harder – they make it possible. Without them, you'd have thousands of identical rectangles and no way to solve it.

Smart designers use three types of constraints:

**Physical constraints** use the properties of objects to limit actions. A car key can only be inserted one way into the ignition.

**Logical constraints** use reasoning and common sense. When assembling furniture, if only one screw is left, it obviously goes in the remaining hole.

**Cultural constraints** rely on shared conventions. In Western cultures, red means stop or danger, so red buttons suggest caution.

**The lesson here:** Well-designed constraints prevent errors before they happen and guide users toward correct actions naturally.

## The Gulf of Execution and Evaluation

Here's where design gets psychological: Norman identified two critical gaps that determine whether people can use products successfully.

The **Gulf of Execution** is the gap between your intentions and the actions you can take. You want to set your alarm clock for 6 AM, but the interface is so confusing you can't figure out how to do it. The wider this gulf, the more difficult the product is to use.

The **Gulf of Evaluation** is the gap between what happened and your understanding of what happened. You pressed some buttons on the alarm clock, but you can't tell if you set it correctly. The display shows "6:00" but you're not sure if that means 6 AM or 6 PM, or if the alarm is even activated.

**Here's what this means for design:** Great products minimize both gulfs. They make it obvious how to do what you want to do, and they make it clear what the results of your actions were.

## The Seven Stages of Action

Every interaction with a designed object follows the same basic pattern. Norman breaks this down into seven stages:

**First**, you **form a goal** – "I want to turn on the lights."

**Second**, you **plan the action** – "I need to find the light switch."

**Third**, you **specify the action sequence** – "I'll flip the switch upward."

**Fourth**, you **perform the action** – you actually flip the switch.

**Fifth**, you **perceive the system state** – you notice whether the lights turned on.

**Sixth**, you **interpret the perception** – you determine if the lights are now at the brightness you wanted.

**Finally**, you **evaluate the outcome** – you decide if your goal was achieved.

Problems can occur at any stage, but good design smooths the entire process. The light switch should be easy to find (planning), obvious to operate (specification and performance), and provide clear results (perception, interpretation, and evaluation).

## Error-Tolerant Design

Here's something counterintuitive: good design assumes people will make errors and plans for them.

Consider the "undo" function in computer software. Before this innovation, every mistake was potentially catastrophic – delete the wrong file and it was gone forever. Undo transformed computers from intimidating machines that punished errors into tools that encouraged experimentation.

Smart designers build in multiple types of error prevention:

**Prevent errors** by making them impossible or difficult to commit. Elevators won't close doors on people, and cars won't let you remove the key while in gear.

**Detect errors** when they do occur and alert users immediately. Spell-checkers catch typos as you type.

**Allow recovery** from errors through undo functions, confirmation dialogs, and reversible actions.

**The key insight:** When people aren't afraid of making mistakes, they become more willing to explore and learn, making the product more valuable to them.

## The Rise of Technology-Centered Design

Let's pause here and consider how technology has complicated design.

In the past, most tools were simple. A hammer works the same way whether you're building a house or hanging a picture. But modern technology creates products with dozens or hundreds of functions, each requiring different procedures.

Take your smartphone. It's simultaneously a phone, camera, music player, navigation system, calculator, calendar, and web browser. This complexity creates what Norman calls the "feature creep" problem – designers keep adding capabilities until the core functions become buried under layers of menus and options.

**This highlights a crucial challenge:** How do you create products that are powerful but not overwhelming? The best designers focus ruthlessly on the most important functions and make them effortlessly accessible.

## Simplicity Through Intelligent Hierarchy

So how do you design complex products that still feel simple? The answer lies in intelligent information hierarchy.

Consider a well-designed kitchen. The most frequently used items – knives, cutting boards, cooking utensils – are immediately accessible. Seasonal items like turkey roasters are stored in hard-to-reach places. This organization matches the frequency of use with ease of access.

The same principle applies to digital interfaces. Your email app puts "compose," "reply," and "delete" prominently on screen because you use them constantly. The "mark as spam" function might be hidden in a menu because you rarely need it.

**This demonstrates that** good design isn't about eliminating features – it's about organizing them according to their importance and frequency of use.

## The Future of Human-Centered Design

As we wrap up, let's consider what all this means for the future of design.

Norman argues that we're moving toward a world where technology adapts to people, rather than people adapting to technology. Voice interfaces like Siri and Alexa represent this shift – instead of learning complex button sequences, you simply speak naturally.

But this evolution requires designers to deeply understand human psychology, behavior, and needs. The most successful products of the future will be those that feel completely intuitive, even when they're performing incredibly complex tasks behind the scenes.

**The ultimate goal of design** should be to create objects that amplify human capabilities while remaining completely transparent in their operation.

## The Key Message

The key message in these lessons:

Good design is invisible. When products are designed well, they become natural extensions of our capabilities, requiring no conscious effort to use. Bad design, on the other hand, makes us feel stupid and frustrated, creating barriers between us and our goals.

The principles Norman outlines – visibility, feedback, constraints, mapping, consistency, and affordance – aren't just theoretical concepts. They're practical tools that can transform any product from confusing to intuitive.

When you understand these principles, you'll start noticing design everywhere. You'll see why some websites feel effortless to navigate while others are confusing. You'll understand why certain apps become indispensable while others get deleted. And most importantly, you'll be able to create or choose products that truly work for people.

**Actionable advice:**

**Think like a first-time user.**

The next time you design something – whether it's a presentation, a spreadsheet, or even instructions for a friend – ask yourself: "If someone encountered this for the first time, with no prior knowledge, would they understand what to do?" This simple question will dramatically improve your design thinking.

Walk through your creation step by step, questioning every assumption and looking for places where confusion might occur. Good design doesn't happen by accident – it results from careful attention to the human experience.

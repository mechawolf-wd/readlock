## 1. Core Philosophy of a Lesson Summary

- **Goal**: Give the reader the 20 % of a book that contains 80 % of the value — in 10–15 minutes.
- **Tone**: Friendly, slightly motivational, conversational mentor who’s excited to share something useful.
- **Reader feeling when finished**: “I get the book now and I already know what to do next.”

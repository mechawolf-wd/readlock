# How Blinkist structures a summary

- **Length & format:** \~15 minutes, available as text and audio.
- **Core unit = "Blinks":** Each book is distilled into \~7--8 _key
  ideas_ ("blinks"), \~200--300 words each, sequenced to tell a
  coherent story.
- **Table of contents of ideas:** A book page shows a **brief
  summary**, then a **list of key ideas** (e.g., "Key idea 1 of
  8..."), plus topical tags.
- **Editorial process:** Blinkist describes a 3-step editorial
  flow---find the book's most important insights, create a structure
  that highlights them, then unify with clear writing.

**What this means in practice (Blinkist):** A Blinkist piece usually
opens with a one-paragraph overview ("brief summary"), then moves
through 7--8 titled idea sections, each a tight explainer with one
takeaway, and ends with a short recap / closing idea cluster.

# How Headway structures a summary

- **Length & format:** \~15 minutes to read or listen; offline audio
  supported.
- **Anatomy:** A Headway summary commonly presents a **list of key
  points**, augmented by a separate list of bite-size **insights**
  (single-line takeaways) and a **conclusion**.
- **Learning features:** Headway explicitly leans on **spaced
  repetition** and **flashcards** to help retention---tying summaries
  to practice objects you revisit.
- **Positioning:** Their own blog emphasizes preserving "author's
  intent and key insights" (editorial positioning against purely
  AI-generated abstracts).

**What this means in practice (Headway):** Expect a faster, more
"snackable" flow: headline key points → one-liner insights (memory
hooks) → brief conclusion, with optional flashcards tied to
spaced-repetition loops.

# Side-by-side: structure & emphasis

- **Chunking:** Both target \~15 minutes and chunk content into
  discrete ideas. Blinkist formalizes this as 7--8 _blinks_; Headway
  uses _key points_ plus micro-insights.
- **On-ramp:** Blinkist reliably starts with a brief summary before
  the ideas; Headway jumps quickly to points/insights.
- **Learning scaffolds:** Headway bakes in flashcards & spaced
  repetition; Blinkist focuses more on editorial clarity and idea
  sequencing (though both have audio).

# A proven content template you can adopt

1.  **Hook (2--3 sentences):** state the problem the book solves and the
    promised outcome. (Blinkist "brief summary" analog.)
2.  **What you'll learn (bulleted):** 3--5 learning objectives.
3.  **Key ideas (6--8 sections, \~200--300 words each):** one idea per
    section with:
    - a clear **claim**,
    - **evidence/example**,
    - an **actionable takeaway** ("try this").
4.  **One-liners (8--12 bullets):** distilled **insights** suitable for
    flashcards/review.
5.  **Recap (5--8 bullets):** restate the arc; optionally **who it's
    for** and **when to use**.
6.  **Practice block:** 3--5 **micro-exercises** or a 7-day micro-plan.
7.  **Review objects:** auto-generate **flashcards** from the one-liners
    and schedule spaced repetition (e.g., 1d/3d/7d/21d).

# What makes a great micro-learning app (takeaways you can build on)

- **Tight scope:** 1 screen = 1 idea; 1 module = 1 outcome.
- **Consistent anatomy:** Users should always find: _hook → what
  you'll learn → ideas → recap → actions → review_.
- **Retrieval over rereading:** Integrate **flashcards**, **quick
  quizzes**, and **spaced repetition**---not just summaries.
- **Actionability:** Every idea ends with a concrete behavior change
  or tactic.
- **Multimodal & mobile-first:** Seamless text↔audio toggle, offline
  listening, background play.
- **Progress & habit loops:** Daily streaks, goals, lightweight
  challenges; surface "what's next" in \<10 seconds.
- **Editorial quality & trust:** Human-guided summaries with citations
  to original ideas; maintain author's intent.
- **Discovery that respects time:** Strong search, tags, and "similar
  ideas" graphs; let users sample a summary to decide whether to read
  the full book.
- **Ethics & rights:** Clear licensing or fair-use strategy for book
  content; accurate attribution; no misleading paraphrases.
- **Data-informed personalization:** Adapt the next bite by user
  goals, time budget, and past recall performance (spaced repetition
  scheduling).

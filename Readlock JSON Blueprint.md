## Part 1: Avoiding AI Writing Patterns in Readlock Content

### The AI Detection Blacklist: Words & Phrases to Avoid

#### Top AI Giveaway Words (Appear 25-100x More in AI Text)

**The Worst Offenders:**

- **navigating** (the #1 AI tell - always appears with problems/challenges)
- **delve/delves** (AI's favorite way to say "look into")
- **meticulous/meticulously** (AI loves unnecessary precision words)
- **realm** (as in "in the realm of" - instant AI flag)
- **embark** (nobody "embarks" in real conversation)
- **unveil/unveiling** (AI's dramatic reveal word)
- **harness** (as in "harness the power" - pure AI)
- **underscore/underscores** (AI's way of emphasizing)
- **tapestry** (AI's pretentious metaphor)
- **landscape** (as in "digital landscape" - corporate AI speak)

#### Overused AI Adjectives & Adverbs

**Dead Giveaways:**

- robust, seamless, comprehensive, intricate, pivotal
- cutting-edge, game-changing, revolutionary, transformative
- ever-evolving, ever-changing, rapidly-evolving, dynamic
- tailored, curated, bespoke, personalized, customized
- paramount, crucial, vital, essential, imperative
- multifaceted, nuanced, sophisticated, elegant
- furthermore, moreover, nevertheless, nonetheless, additionally

#### Cringe AI Phrases (Never Use These)

**Opening Clichés:**

- "In today's digital age..."
- "In the fast-paced world of..."
- "Welcome to the world of..."
- "Let's dive into..."
- "Let's explore..."
- "Join me on a journey..."

**Middle Filler:**

- "It's worth noting that..."
- "It's important to understand..."

- "When it comes to..."
- "At the heart of..."
- "The beauty of X lies in..."

**Closing Clichés:**

- "In conclusion..."
- "The key takeaway is..."
- "As we've seen..."
- "This brings us one step closer..."
- "The possibilities are endless..."
- "The future is bright for..."

#### Educational Content AI Red Flags

**Never Write:**

- "In this lesson, you will learn..."
- "By the end of this module..."
- "Let's unpack this concept..."
- "This demonstrates the importance of..."
- "As we can see from this example..."
- "Upon completion, students will be able to..."
- "This serves as a reminder that..."
- "It's fascinating to note..."

#### Corporate AI Buzzword Bingo

**Instant Cringe:**

- best practices, key learnings, action items
- circle back, deep dive, move the needle
- paradigm shift, thinking outside the box

#### AI's Favorite Unnecessary Phrases

**Just Delete These:**

- "designed to enhance" → just say "improves"
- "it is advisable to" → just say "should"
- "in the realm of" → just say "in"
- "serves to highlight" → just say "shows"
- "it's crucial to note" → just start with the point
- "this underscores the fact that" → just state it
- "brings to light" → just say "reveals"

#### AI Writing Patterns That Scream "Not Human"

**Structural Tells:**

1. Perfect three-part lists everywhere
2. Topic sentence → Evidence → Summary (every paragraph)
3. Transition words starting every other sentence
4. Consistent sentence length (no variety)
5. Always ending with forward-looking statements
6. Using "however" or "moreover" to start sentences
7. Perfect grammar with zero contractions

#### The Fake Enthusiasm Package

**Never Use:**

- "Exciting journey ahead!"
- "Unleash your potential!"
- "Revolutionize the way you..."
- "Transform your understanding..."
- "Unlock the secrets of..."
- "Master the art of..."
- "Elevate your skills..."

### Readlock-Specific Cringe to Avoid

**Academic Distance:**

- "The learner will discover..." → "You'll find out..."
- "One might observe..." → "You'll notice..."
- "It becomes apparent..." → "You see it..."
- "This concept illustrates..." → "Here's what happens..."

**Fake Conversational:**

- "Now, you might be wondering..." (nobody wonders on cue)
- "Let me tell you..." (just tell them)
- "Here's the thing..." (overused fake casual)
- "Buckle up!" (trying too hard)
- "Ready to dive in?" (forced enthusiasm)

### The AI Tell in Educational Content

- **Perfect lesson structure**: Introduction → Explanation → Example → Summary
- **Over-explanation**: Telling instead of showing through story
- **Corporate learning language**: "Upon completion of this module..."
- **Fake enthusiasm**: "Exciting journey through learning!"
- **Academic distance**: Third-person explanations instead of direct engagement

## Part 2: Natural Writing Techniques for Readlock

### 1. The Readlock Story Method

```json
BAD (AI-like):
{
  "text-segments": [
    "Today we will learn about design principles.",
    "Affordances are visual cues that suggest how an object should be used.",
    "For example, a door handle indicates that you should pull.",
    "This concept is fundamental to good design."
  ]
}

GOOD (Human, Readlock-style):
{
  "text-segments": [
    "Sarah approaches the hotel door.",
    "Glass panel with a vertical metal plate.",
    "Her brain screams 'pull this!'",
    "She pulls. Nothing. The door needs a push."
  ]
}
```

### 2. Mobile-First Segment Writing

**The 2-4 Sentence Rule:**

- Segment 1: Set the scene or pose the problem
- Segment 2: Add tension or specificity
- Segment 3: Reveal or twist
- Segment 4: Leave them wanting more

**Example:**

```
"Look at this kettle."
"image-link:assets/kettle.png"
"The handle is on the same side as the spout."
"When you pour, steam burns your hand."
```

### 3. Progressive Engagement Patterns

Start simple, build complexity:

- First segment: Concrete, visual, immediate
- Second segment: Add one layer of complexity
- Third segment: Connect to bigger idea
- Fourth segment: Cliffhanger or question

Never front-load concepts. Let understanding emerge.

### 4. Readlock Question Writing

```
BAD (Academic):
"What is the primary function of affordances in design?"

GOOD (Curious):
"Why did Sarah's brain tell her to pull?"

BAD (Testing):
"Which of the following best describes Norman doors?"

GOOD (Thinking):
"That hotel door—was it Sarah's fault or the designer's?"
```

## Part 3: Readlock-Specific Content Guidelines

### Intro Sections

- Start with action or observation, never explanation
- Use present tense for immediacy
- Maximum 3 segments
- End with intrigue, not summary

```json
{
  "entity-type": "intro",
  "text-segments": [
    "Every day, objects silently communicate.",
    "A door handle says 'pull me'.",
    "But what happens when objects lie?"
  ]
}
```

### Text Content Sections

- Each segment = one camera shot or thought
- Use line breaks for dramatic pauses
- Include sensory details sparingly but vividly
- Never explain what the story already shows

### Interactive Questions

**Multiple Choice:**

- Wrong answers should be tempting, not obviously wrong
- Each option under 10 words
- Feedback explains through story, not lecture

**True/False:**

- Statement should feel like a bet, not a test
- Make them pause and think
- "The kettle's handle placement was intentional" (not "The kettle has poor design")

**Reflection Questions:**

- Personal connection, not abstract thinking
- "When have you wrestled with a confusing door?"
- Not "How do affordances impact daily life?"

### Skill Checks

- Frame as challenges, not tests
- "Can you spot the design flaw?"
- Celebrate discovery, not correctness

### Emotional Slides

- Use for genuine moments, not forced sentiment
- Connect to reader's actual experience
- "That moment when the door finally opens..."

## Part 4: The Readlock Voice

### Core Voice Characteristics

- **Observational**: "Notice how..." instead of "It's important to understand..."
- **Conspiratorial**: "Here's what designers don't tell you..."
- **Direct**: "You've done this" not "One might experience..."
- **Specific**: "Sarah's hand" not "the user's appendage"

### Age-Appropriate Variations

**For younger readers (10-14):**

- Shorter sentences (5-10 words)
- Concrete examples from their world
- "Your locker combination lock"
- Questions that feel like riddles

**For teens (15-18):**

- Slightly longer sentences (8-15 words)
- References to their experiences
- "That confusing app interface"
- Questions that challenge assumptions

**For adults:**

- Varied sentence length (5-20 words)
- Professional contexts when relevant
- "Your office coffee machine"
- Questions that connect to bigger ideas

## Part 5: Quality Checklist for Readlock Content

### Before Writing

- [ ] Read existing Readlock content to match voice
- [ ] Plan story beats, not information points
- [ ] Choose specific objects/characters/scenarios
- [ ] Map emotional trajectory across segments

### During Writing

- [ ] Each segment can stand alone visually
- [ ] No segment over 4 sentences
- [ ] Concrete imagery in first segment
- [ ] Natural breaking points for animation
- [ ] Questions emerge from story naturally

### After Writing (The Readlock Test)

- [ ] Read aloud with pauses between segments
- [ ] Would this work as a film scene?
- [ ] Can you picture each segment clearly?
- [ ] Does curiosity pull you forward?
- [ ] Is the educational content invisible?

"Timing beats originality every time."
```

### Theme Development Checklist

Before choosing a theme:

- [ ] Is this genuinely interesting without the education?
- [ ] Can readers relate regardless of background?
- [ ] Does it reveal something hidden in plain sight?
- [ ] Will it age well or become dated quickly?

During theme development:

- [ ] Include sensory details from real experiences
- [ ] Reference actual brands/places when helpful
- [ ] Connect to emotions, not just observations
- [ ] Layer complexity without losing clarity

After theme implementation:

- [ ] Would someone share this as interesting trivia?

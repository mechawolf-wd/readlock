- [ ] No "Let's explore" or "Let's dive"
- [ ] Contractions used (it's, don't, won't)
- [ ] Varying sentence lengths (count them!)
- [ ] Some sentences are fragments. Like this.
- [ ] No perfect three-part lists
- [ ] Would you actually say this out loud?

## 💡 REMEMBER

**AI writes like a corporate robot trying to sound smart.**
**Humans write like they're texting a friend who needs help.**

Keep it simple. Keep it real. Kill the fancy words.

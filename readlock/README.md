# readlock

A new Flutter project.

## Bookshelf as Social Currency

The bookshelf feature in Readlock transcends traditional reading lists by transforming personal libraries into a form of social currency. Users curate their digital bookshelves not just as private collections, but as public expressions of intellectual identity and cultural capital. Each displayed book becomes a conversation starter, a badge of knowledge, or a signal of interests that connects like-minded readers. This gamification of reading habits creates a virtuous cycle where users are motivated to read more diversely and deeply, knowing their bookshelf serves as both a personal achievement tracker and a social profile that demonstrates their literary journey to peers.
